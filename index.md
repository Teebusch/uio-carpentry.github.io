# Carpentry at the University of Oslo

![](img/uio-carpentry-logo.png)


[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a volunteer organisation teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.

At the University of Oslo ([UiO](uio.no)) Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry workshops are offered to graduates and researchers from all faculties and units to facilitate sharing and re-using of data.

We use this page for listing *previous Carpentry* workshops at the UiO.
<!-- I put the upcoming workshops in the list, but out-commented them, so they won't be shown. If we the workshop has happened, take the comment brackets away and voilá! -->
