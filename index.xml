========================
`Carpentry@UiO `_
is the UiO local relay of the international
`Carpentries `_ organisation.
We are a group of volunteers from the University of Oslo and beyond.
With support from the University of Oslo Library,
we offer to PhD students, researchers and others at UiO, and beyond:
- foundational coding and data science skills workshops from
`Software Carpentry `_ and
`Data Carpentry `_
- `Study Group events `_
dedicated to open and reproducible science, knowledge sharing,
re-enforcing learning or discussing new subjects for
future workshops/lesson development
- educational development and networking opportunities with the possibility
to become Certified Carpentries Instructor
and/or Carpentries Instructor Trainer
Our activities and community are open to any member of the UiO community
including staff, faculty, and students, paid, and volunteer.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/report_2015/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/report_2015/</guid><description>Software Carpentry at the University of Oslo in 2015 and 2016 # Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose goal is to make scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching them basic computing skills. Founded in 1998, it runs short, intensive workshops that cover program design, version control, testing, and task automation.
In 2015, the (then) only two certified Software Carpentry instructors, Karin Lagesen and Lex Nederbragt, started a collaboration with the Science Library (Realfagsbilbioteket), with the goal to offer more workshops and recruit more instructors.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/report_carpentry-uio_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/report_carpentry-uio_2019/</guid><description>Carpentry@UiO 2019 Annual Report # Learner Feedback and Continuous Evaluation # Spring Term 2019 # See the detailed report for the spring term 2019 Report Spring 2019 Fall Term 2019 # See the detailed report for 2019 incl. the feedback for the fall term 2019 Workshops # Programming with Python (novices) - Feb 8, 2019 Introduction to Version Control with Git (novices) - Feb 15, 2019 Git in Practice (intermediate) - Feb 27, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - Mar 8, 2019 Unix Shell (novices) - Apr 24, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - May 15, 2019 Introduction to R with Tidyverse (pt.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/report_carpentry-uio_2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/report_carpentry-uio_2020/</guid><description>Carpentry@UiO 2020 Annual Report # Report written by Naoe Tatara and Annika Rockenberger (both University of Oslo library)

Introduction # Data Collection # An online survey was created using Nettskjema (University of Oslo web-tool for surveys). The questions asked can be found in the survey document. The survey was then send to the organizers mailing list on Oct 10. A reminder to participate in the survey was sent out to the same list on Oct 16 and Nov 06.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/summary_feedback_carpentries_spring_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/summary_feedback_carpentries_spring_2019/</guid><description>Carpentries-Workshops Spring 2019 &amp;ndash; Summary Of Learners' Feedback # Workshops # Workshops We Taught # Python (novices) - Feb 8, 2019 Intro to Git (novices) - Feb 15, 2019 Git in Practice (intermediate) - Feb 27, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - Mar 8, 2019 Unix Shell (novices) - Apr 24, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - May 15, 2019 Introduction to R with Tidyverse (pt.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/summary_feedback_uio-carpentry_2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/summary_feedback_uio-carpentry_2019/</guid><description>Carpentries-Workshops 2019 &amp;ndash; Summary Of Learners' Feedback # Data and Data Analysis # After every workshop taught by Carpentry@UiO, a post-workshop feedback survey is sent out to participants, circa one-two weeks after the workshop. The responses are collected in Nettskjema. For this report, I have downloaded the data from the main Nettkjema survey as well as the data from two survey forms that were created for the GitHub workshop in September 2019 and the Databases and SQL workshop in October 2019.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/survey_instructor-status_2019-09-26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teebusch.github.io/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/survey_instructor-status_2019-09-26/</guid><description>Survey – Carpentry@UiO Instructor Status Quo # Introduction and Purpose # Dear fellow Carpenter!
The Carpentry@UiO community is alive and well – a new team of coordinators from the University Library together with the Interim Board are working hard to support you in teaching workshops in the Carpentries spirit.
In order to gain a better and more up-to-date overview of who we are as a community, the Interim Board and the University Library have created a short survey about the status quo of our instructors.</description></item></channel></rss>
