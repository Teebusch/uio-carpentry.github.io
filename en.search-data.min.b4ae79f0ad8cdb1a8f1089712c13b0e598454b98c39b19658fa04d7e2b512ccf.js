Founded in 1998, it runs short, intensive workshops that cover program design, version control, testing, and task automation.\nIn 2015, the (then) only two certified Software Carpentry instructors, Karin Lagesen and Lex Nederbragt, started a collaboration with the Science Library (Realfagsbilbioteket), with the goal to offer more workshops and recruit more instructors.\nThis document is a summary of our activities in 2015 and our thoughts of continuing the effort in 2016.\nActivities in 2015 #   We have offered three workshops to UiO and OUS staff, in February, June and December 101 PhDs, Postdocs, master students and other staff registered for these workshops We taught in total 70 participants Registrants came from Geosciences, Biosciences (IBV), Medical Genetics, Oslo University Hospital, Astrophysics, Pharmacy, Mathematics, the Natural History Museum, Chemistry, the Science Library (Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences) and the Department of Literature, Area Studies and European Languages (Faculty of Humanities) We went from two certified, volunteer instructors to four And additional five people took the Software Carpentry instructor training and are close to becoming certified Three more persons have helped at workshops and shown interest to become instructors we started using email lists  organizers@swcarpentry.uio.no for the instructors and helpers announce@swcarpentry.uio.no for announcements of new workshops and other events discussions@swcarpentry.uio.no for discussing amongst past participants and instructors/helpers    Workshops were organised with the following program:\n day 1, morning, task automation with unix day 1, afternoon, version control with git and github day 2, introduction to python and modular program design  The interest for these workshops demonstrates that there is a clear need for the type of training Software Carpentry offers. Many researchers will need to analyse, or write tools to analyse, larger and larger datasets, but lack the formal training to do this effectively. Software Carpentry addresses this gap as a grassroots organisation, taught by researchers for researchers.\nThe help of the Science Library has been very important, they book rooms, arrange registration (both sign-up before the workshop, and at the beginning of the workshops) and generally make it very easy for the instructors to fully focus on the teaching itself.\nOutlook for 2016 #  Given the interest in 2015, we foresee a significant growth and expansion of the Software Carpentry effort in 2016.\nIn 2016, we expect to:\n Offer at least 6 workshops Add modules on the R programming language Participate in the planned ‘Carpentry week’ around the Science Library birthday celebrations in March, with multiple workshops, round table-discussions etc.; we have already a confirmation from Data Carpentry that their Executive Director will visit Oslo to participate that week Start offering Intermediate level workshops with more advanced version control, scientific python etc (for this we need to train instructors or invite experienced volunteer instructors and refund them their travel and lodging) Start offering Data Carpentry workshops. Data Carpentry’s mission (http://www.datacarpentry.org) is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research with a focus on computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research At least double the number of certified instructors and the number of helpers Have at least four certified Data Carpentry instructors  One of our goals is to convince the University of Oslo to become an Software Carpentry Foundation Affiliate. Such a status is a prerequisite for having prioritised access to instructor training (for which there is overwhelming interest). Affiliate status has relatively few requirements/costs for UiO, while there are several benefits.

End-of-the-Year Social Get-Together for the community on Dec 12, 2019  StudyGroup #   The Carpentry@UiO community has taken initiative for a StudyGroup in 2018. The aim was to create a forum for instructors, helpers, and other interested parties to meet and share expertise, information, and experience related to teaching workshops. Since then, the StudyGroup has served as a forum for knowledge exchange and social interaction with meetings ca. every other week. Topics that were covered incl.:  NetworkX, pytest, folium, ipyleaflet, Voilá (Python packages and applications) Deep Learning with R Social Coding and Open Software Open Science Framework National Data Archives Instructor Development Book Club (Teaching Tech Together, Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing)   Documentation of all events and materials are publishied on the website of the StudyGroup Activities are announced via the @swcarpentry mailing lists, the official website, a Google calendar, and the University Library\u0026rsquo;s course catalogue, and Gitter  Recruiting #   2019 has been a record year in terms of recruitment and instructor trainees.

Due to the problems described in the next section, we have not yet gotten access to the whole dataset. However, the responses given in 5-Likert scale were mostly positive.\nOn the other hand, the responses written in free text are summarised in \u0026ldquo;Carpentries-survey-results\u0026rdquo; Sheet in Carpentry@UiO G Suite shared drive, which is accessible only to board members. If the contents are deemed to be non-person identifiable, this can be archived in GitHub repository in .tsv format.\nMajor strength #  Among the 47 responses (in total for all the workshops) on major strength of the workshop, the following is found as commonly expressed.\n Access to helpers and responsive instructors Learners appreciated that their problems were quickly solved by the helpers and instructors. Easy to follow and understand Clear instructions from basics, good pace, access to written lesson materials are much appreciated. Good lesson materials and hands-on style Practical exercises with realistic examples well mixed with lectures were raised as a solid strength.  What to be improved #  From the 36 free-text responses (in total for all the workshops) on something to be improved, the following are found to be major issues.\n Time allocation For example, a suggestion for two days instead of one day, felt the pace is faster in the latter part compared to the time spent on the basic parts in the morning. Preparation Both for learners and instructors. Lack of preparation should not drain others' (regardless of the role) time. Clearer description of the workshop contents and prerequisites These are expressed in terms of the level of the workshops and the skills that were necessary for the workshop (such as the use of the command-line interface).  How instructors and helpers affected learning experiences #  Most of the 36 free-text responses (in total for all the workshops) on how instructors and helpers affected learning experiences, were about quick and flexible help on troubles learners got.\nOther minor opinions include themes relevant to the preparation mentioned above. In online workshops, effective use of helpers was raised as a factor that affects learning experiences on both positive and negative side.\nSurvey in future #  Using the Carpentries survey was found to have some drawbacks.\n Low response rate The response rates, especially for the post-workshop survey, were generally low (mostly less than half). Limited access to results When the number of responses is less than 10, the system does not allow downloading result data but only show the summary. Naoe has requested the core team to gather all the responses to the surveys for UiO workshops in 2020, but the data is not yet available. Not fully applicable/relevant questions Beside the questions asked are not necessarily very relevant to each workshop, as the workshop by Carpentry@UiO mostly focuses on single-lesson rather than the two-day standard workshops.  The Board on the 9th Dec discussed and decided to continue using the Carpentries survey. Instructor onboarding manual is to be edited to make sure that the instructors keep the last 5 minutes for completing the post-workshop survey. (Link to board meeting Minutes: https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/201209_board_meeting.md)\nAlso, some fundamental questions that the Library is interested in will be implemented in the sign-up form.\nWorkshops #  UiO-Carpentry arranged altogether 11 one-day Software Carpentry workshops (most of which could be taught on-site) and was part of two two-day Data Carpentry workshops and two half-day mini-workshops (conducted online). During spring/summer and late fall Software Carpentry workshops were moved online, while several workshops in early fall could be arranged on-site with reduced participant numbers.\nFor the 11 Carpentry workshops arranged by UiO-Carpentry, in total, 492 sign-ups were made. Total capacity was 283, and the number of learners who attended was in total 187. Due to even more limited access to rooms in addition to the reduced capacity of each room at UiO, the in-person workshop capacity in the Autumn semester was reduced to approximately 1/3 of that of Spring semester before covid-19 related restrictions applied.\nOne-day workshops #   January Writing and Publishing Together on the Web Using GitHub - on-site January Plotting and Programming with Python - on-site January R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis - on-site February The Bash Shell - on-site February Python (intermediate) - on-site February Version Control with Git - on-site May Version Control with Git - Online - online September The Unix Shell - on-site September Version Control with Git - on-site October R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis - on-site November Databases and SQL - online  Two-day workshops #  Two Data Carpentry online workshops arranged by Nord University were open for external participants from Norway.

Community Building \u0026amp; Social Events #  COVID-19 posed a challenge in regards to community building and arranging social events for UiO-Carpentry. With moving many activities online and good communication with our members, we managed to organise a fair number of social events and community activities.\nOnboarding #  Three onboarding sessions were held, two on-site sessions in January 2020 and one online session in September 2020. Onboarding is intended for new instructors and helpers and as a general information exchange around the practicalities of running Carpentry workshops at UiO. Materials for the onboarding events are updated continuously and can be accessed on GitHub, UiO-Carpentry/organisational/workshop_operations\nStudyGroup #  4 StudyGroup meetings were held between January and early March 2020. Moving the StudyGroup online seemed like a good solution. Still, participation dwindled towards summer (3 meetings were held), likely as a result of overexposure to online meetings, conferences, and workshops etc. The StudyGroup was thus put on halt during the fall.\nRecruiting #  Four new instructors (with a focus on R) could be recruited for UiO-Carpentry, another instructor is in training. Two seats came out of the NeiC CodeRefinery Platinum Membership (UiO members were eligible due to UiO\u0026rsquo;s membership in NeiC). Besides, an already certified instructor recently joined UiO. Several new helpers could be recruited and supported workshops, both on-site and online during 2020.\nThe Carpentries record shows that eight seats were used in the membership year of May 2019 to May 2020, which exceeds the reserved spots by 2. On the 8th Dec 2020, it is however shown that UiO has six seats remaining for the membership period of August 2020 to August 2021. Naoe made an inquiry regarding the number of seats reserved for UiO during the current membership period to the core team and is still waiting for confirmation.\nActively recruiting candidates from the UiO-Carpentry community for these spots had to be postponed to 2021. Several potential instructors declined the offer due to lack of time. More active recruitment has to be initiated in early 2021.\nSocial Events #  Two social events for the UiO-Carpentry community were arranged online, one at the end of summer and one before Christmas 2020. They were held online.\n 2020-09-17: UiO-Carpentry \u0026ldquo;fika\u0026rdquo;-time 2020-12-17: UiO-Carpentry Christmas mingle  In addition, two online meetings for the Nordic-Baltic Carpentries region were held online, hosted by the UiO-Carpentry local coordinator (AR) and the regional coordinator for the Nordic and Baltic countries (NT).\n 2020-08-07: Social Meetup during CarpentryCon@Home (16 participants) 2020-10-30: Community Discussion for Nordic-Baltic Carpentries (15 participants) (A blog post is published based on this at CodeRefinery website and is to be published at the Carpentries, (PR))  Organisation #  Local Community Coordinator #  The tasks of the local community coordinator were shared by AR and NT (both University of Oslo Library). In practice, this means support in recruiting instructors and helpers for workshops, setting up workshop websites, setting up and managing workshop registration, communication with workshop participants, communication with The Carpentries regarding workshops, maintenance of the UiO-Carpentry websites hosted by UiO/UBO as well as the community website hosted on GitHub, managing mailing lists, communication with the UiO-community via mailing lists, booking rooms and/or setting up virtual rooms, checking in with instructors and helpers before and after workshops.\nThe local coordinators established and documented effective routines for most tasks regarding hosting workshops and community-communication.\nBoard #  In March 2020, the UiO-Carpentry Board was successfully constituted. The election took place in February, and four Board Members were elected for a term of 2 years. In addition, the UiO library appointed two Board Members.

GitHub, Communication #  All official documentation of workshops and other activities of UiO-Carpentry is published under the UiO-Carpentry GitHub organisation. The GitHub repositories are actively maintained by the community, the Board, and the local coordinators. Apart from repositories for workshop websites, UiO-Carpentry maintains the following community repositories:\n governance (community statutes, code of conduct, procedures) organisational (reports, onboarding documents, how-tos) studygroup (StudyGroup website and events) uio-carpentry.github.io (previous workshop and calendar)  A significant change was made to communications: the domain for the UiO-Carpentry mailing lists was changed from @swcarpentry to @carpentry. Also, one underused mailing list was discarded (resbaz).\nThe community now actively uses the following mailing lists:\n carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; coordinators at the University Library and the chairperson of the Carpentry@UiO Board organisers @ carpentry dot uio dot no \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; all instructors and helpers, plus those on the carpadmin list announcements @ carpentry dot uio dot no \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organisers list contact-us @ carpentry dot uio dot no\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; coordinators at the University Library.

There are now 41 active members on the list of previously \u0026gt;80 of unclear status.\nVia the list, instructors and helpers for workshops are recruited, and information relevant to the UiO-Carpentry community is communicated.\n"});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/report_instructor-status-survey_2019-11-07/','title':"Report Instructor Status Survey 2019 11 07",'section':"Reports",'content':"Report of the Instructor Status Survey 2019 #  Author: Annika Rockenberger Date: Nov 7, 2019\nIntroduction #  Data Collection #  An online survey was created using Nettskjema (University of Oslo web-tool for surveys). The questions asked can be found in the survey document. The survey was then send to the organizers mailing list on Oct 10. A reminder to participate in the survey was sent out to the same list on Oct 16 and Nov 06. On Nov 07, 20 submissions were registered. Assuming that of the 68 subscribers to the mailing list at least 5 are staff support, the participation in the survey was ca. 1/3.\nDue to confidentiality reasons, the data this report is based on cannot be published. It is accessible for members of the Board via the University of Oslo G-Suite. The data will be deleted no later than Nov 7, 2024.\nOverall Impression #  Overall, the people who responded to the survey are known local instructors, with a few exceptions. Of the 12 people who participated in the instructor training in summer 2019, 4 submitted their answers to the survey.\nCritique #  Even though the survey was mainly targeted at instructors, it was open for helpers, too. It was, however, not designed to capture the helper-function properly. This is a flaw. Based on the comments received in the survey, at least two people have been active as helpers and not as instructors.\nAre you a certified Carpentries-instructor? #     Yes No     13 7    11 Oslo-based Carpentries Instructors on Carpentries website, cross-check revealed ca. 50% overlap.\nHow many times per year are you willing to teach or co-teach a Carpentries workshop at UiO? #     Number of instructors Teachings per year     13 2   6 3-5   2 1   1* \u0026gt;5    *(as helper)\nWhich lesson(s) are you comfortable teaching or co-teaching? #  Software Carpentry #  Our staple lessons are Unix Shell, Git, and Python; a good amount of instructors are versed in R, too. We have far less people feeling comfortable teaching SQL and Make.\nData Carpentry #  Significantly less people feel they can teach Data Carpentry. 2 indicated they could teach the Ecology lesson, 3 the Genomics lesson and 2 were comfortable teaching Geospatial Data.\nHowever, 9 indicated they could teach a Carpentries-inspired GitHub lesson.\nSupport from local UiO-Carpentry community #  Everyone except 2 responded that they feel they get enough support from UiO-Carpentry. The two which responded negatively were asked for feedback (in the form) and answered that they didn\u0026rsquo;t ask for support or that since they are a helper they didn\u0026rsquo;t feel it applied to them.\nWorkshop organisation and support #  Asked whether they feel they know who to set up a workshop website and run a workshop at UiO, 16 answered in the affirmative.\n4 stated they did not feel they know how to do those things. Their explanations were that they either didn\u0026rsquo;t mind since they could ask for information when needed, that they felt they needed to try it out to get used to it or that the question didn\u0026rsquo;t apply to them since they were helpers, not instructors.\nRegistration via AMY, Carpentries instructor database #  11 stated they were registered. The list of people doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the information publicly available on Carpentries.org (however, Carpentries.org states that not all information is shown and that there might be a lag. It is ultimately up to the individual instructor to keep their profile up to date).\n9 stated they aren\u0026rsquo;t instructors, with at least some indicating that they would like to become instructors or are in the process of checking-out.\nAnything you would like to let us know #  Ca. half of the participants left a comment. Mostly indicating their willingness to teach (more) and explanations for why they haven\u0026rsquo;t contributed as much as they would have wanted.\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/summary_feedback_carpentries_spring_2019/','title':"Summary Feedback Carpentries Spring 2019",'section':"Reports",'content':"Carpentries-Workshops Spring 2019 \u0026ndash; Summary Of Learners' Feedback #  Workshops #  Workshops We Taught #   Python (novices) - Feb 8, 2019 Intro to Git (novices) - Feb 15, 2019 Git in Practice (intermediate) - Feb 27, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - Mar 8, 2019 Unix Shell (novices) - Apr 24, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - May 15, 2019 Introduction to R with Tidyverse (pt. 1) - May 22, 2019 Introduction to R with Tidyverse (pt. 2) - May 29, 2019 Getting your hands on climate data (novices) - Jun 7, 2019  Carpentries @ UiO was also involved in the ResearchBazaar 2019\n Two-day Learn Deep-Learning with Python One-day Get (even) smarter with the Unix Shell Half-day Publication Ready Scientific Reports with Jupyter Notebook Half-day Getting Started with Open Science Framework  Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to update the workshop and course registry on our website https://uio-carpentry.github.io/ - everyone can edit the file index.md in our GitHub repository https://github.com/uio-carpentry/uio-carpentry.github.io\nUtilization #  We had booked rooms for 19 full-day workshops, we held 9 workshops.\nFeedback From Our Learners #  We got feedback for 6 workshops.\nWho Are Our Learners? #  The Majority of our learners are Phds - and researchers on various levels. We have a few students, mainly on masters' level, and a couple of engineers with various backgrounds.\nThere seems to be confusion about what to choose as \u0026ldquo;role\u0026rdquo;; perhaps we could add an explanation to the Nettskjema or add more fields to choose from?\nWhich Institutions Are Our Learners Affiliated With? #  The vast majority is from UiO. A few learners are from other universities: OsloMet (1) and NMBU (5). Some are from the University Hospital (3), the Veterinarian Institute (1), The Institute of Cancer Research (1) NIVA (3), Noroff (1) and TØI (1). The individual departments are rarely mentioned.\nA third of those filling out the Nettskjema did not write their institutional affiliation: Why? \u0026ndash; There seems to be confusion around what we are asking for here, and perhaps: Why we want to know their affiliation in the first place.\nWhat Workshop or Topics Are Our Learners Missing? #    Summing up from the surveys, most learners are interested in learning any or more of Python and R. Most want to use it for data analysis, thus requesting focus on packages like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy etc.\n  They also want more targeted courses on specific kinds of data (e.g. ecology, climate, bio, archeology, spatio-temporal).\n  Generally, learners ask to learn more about statistics or want to do more practical statistical analysis with R or Python.\n  Additionally, plotting and visualization are requested.\n  Indepented from language, many learners asked for workshops dealing with data preparation and data cleaning - basically everything that happens before analysis.\n  Machine learning is more and more requested.\n  Generally, there is a need for more workshops on advanced levels. Learners who aren\u0026rsquo;t novices anymore don\u0026rsquo;t seem to find workshops for their level; this might also be a reason for why our workshops often have quite advanced learners even though they are explicitely targeted towards novices \u0026ndash; an issue that occasionally leads to overbooked workshops and dissatisfied learners and teachers.\n  There is also the request for workshops for specific tools, like SPSS. USIT has courses; we could consider spreading information about these at our workshops.\n  Summing up: Including more Data Carpentry workshops could help meet the learners\u0026rsquo;s needs.\n  Comments and Constructive Criticism #   Generally, our learners really appreciate that we offer workshops on a variety of topics and rate the workshops overall very positively. Our instructors are highly regarded for their enthusiasm, teaching spirit and patience and the helper-system gets univocally positive feedback.  Positives are: Helpers and individual assistance \u0026ndash; enthusiastic teachers \u0026ndash; pedagogic teaching \u0026ndash; good atmosphere \u0026ndash; real life examples (data, code)\n There is a certain amount of criticism, not all of which is directed at our workshop organisation and instructores. Generally, communication before the workshop could be improved. Prior to the workshops, clearer instructions on installation of software, download of data sets or code bits and ** quick self-tests are recommended. Apart from that, learners would like to get a more realistic schedule for the the workshop: will the topics mentioned in the schedule actually be taught in the workshop. (Comment AR: We have experienced that we are note able to teach the entire Python module in one day; of 10 lessons we manage 6; the course description has the entire 10 lessons, thus creating expectations we cannot meet). Time management and workshop logistics have been mentioned as an area of improvement, especially when it comes to breaks. Overall, our instructors and helpers receive very positive feedback. However, live coding and navigation speed is sometimes an issue as are too short or missing explanations. Most criticism is directed at co-learners who arrive unprepared which leads to delays and occupies helpers and instructors  Are We Reaching Our Goals With Software Carpentry? #  YES. We reach them fully \u0026ndash; or at least somewhat.\nShould We Have Other And More Workshops at UiO? #  Overwhelmingly YES.\nWould You Recommend This Workshop To A Friend Or Colleague? #  Overwhelmingly, learners strongly agree or agree that they would recommend our workshops. Only a tiny number is either neutral, or disagrees.\nHave You, After The Course, Used What You Learned? #  Half answered that they haven\u0026rsquo;t yet used what they\u0026rsquo;ve learned but might in the future, while roughly a third answered that they have used some of it. A little less than a quarter of learners said they\u0026rsquo;ve used most or all of it. Only one person had not used anything at all.\nWas This Workshop Worth My Time? #  Overwhelmingly, learners answered that they strongly agreed or agreed that the workshop was worth their time. A few were neutral as to whether it was worth their time, while 3 disagreed or strongly disagreed.\nHow Much Practical Knowledge Did You Gain From The Workshop? #  Much more than half of the learners answered that they learned a great deal, while roughly a third answered that they gained some practical knowledge. One answered that they gained none.\n"});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/summary_feedback_uio-carpentry_2019/','title':"Summary Feedback Uio Carpentry 2019",'section':"Reports",'content':"Carpentries-Workshops 2019 \u0026ndash; Summary Of Learners' Feedback #  Data and Data Analysis #  After every workshop taught by Carpentry@UiO, a post-workshop feedback survey is sent out to participants, circa one-two weeks after the workshop. The responses are collected in Nettskjema. For this report, I have downloaded the data from the main Nettkjema survey as well as the data from two survey forms that were created for the GitHub workshop in September 2019 and the Databases and SQL workshop in October 2019. The questions in all survey forms were identical.\nAfter downloading the survey data (tabular data) as an Excel spreadsheet, I have combined the data from all three spreadsheets into one single spreadsheet. Due to the nature of some of the questions, the values in the columns \u0026ldquo;Professional Role\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Institutional Affiliation\u0026rdquo; vary greatly. I have normalised the values for both columns manually. I.e. the different spelling variations of \u0026ldquo;University of Oslo\u0026rdquo; have been normalised to \u0026ldquo;UiO\u0026rdquo;, while all departmental affiliations were omitted, since they were not stated in more than 50% of responses. For the values in \u0026ldquo;Professional Role\u0026rdquo; I have looked at the free text option for \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; and normalised the responses to either fit the pre-set values (e.g. \u0026ldquo;researcher\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;PhD\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;PostDoc\u0026rdquo;) or made the role more explicit (e.g. \u0026ldquo;database administrator\u0026rdquo;).\nFor the simple analyses, I have used the Pivot-table function in MS Excel and created bar charts.\nThe original data (anonymised) is stored on a UiO G-Suite directory and can be accessed upon request.\nWorkshops #  Workshops We Taught #   Python (novices) - Feb 8, 2019 Intro to Git (novices) - Feb 15, 2019 Git in Practice (intermediate) - Feb 27, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - Mar 8, 2019 Unix Shell (novices) - Apr 24, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - May 15, 2019 Introduction to R with Tidyverse (pt. 1) - May 22, 2019 Introduction to R with Tidyverse (pt. 2) - May 29, 2019 Getting your hands on climate data (novices) - Jun 7, 2019 Writing and Publishing Together on the Web Using GitHub (novices) - Sep 11, 2019 Plotting and Programming with Python (novices) - Sep 16, 2019 Databases and SQL - Oct 28, 2019 R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis (novices) - Nov 19, 2019  Carpentries @ UiO was also involved in the ResearchBazaar 2019\n Two-day Learn Deep-Learning with Python One-day Get (even) smarter with the Unix Shell Half-day Publication Ready Scientific Reports with Jupyter Notebook Half-day Getting Started with Open Science Framework  The workshop and course registry on the Carpentry@UiO website is continuously updated https://uio-carpentry.github.io/ The course catalogue of Carpentry workshops taught at UiO is keeping a backlog (\u0026ldquo;Previous\u0026rdquo;), too\nUtilisation #  We had booked rooms for 34 full-day workshops, we held 13 workshops and two on-boarding sessions (both on the same day).\nFeedback From Our Learners #  We got feedback for 10 workshops from 103 participants.\nWho Are Our Learners? #  Which Institutions Are Our Learners Affiliated With? #  Are We Reaching Our Goals With Software Carpentry? #  Would You Recommend This Workshop To A Friend Or Colleague? #  Have You, After The Course, Used What You Learned? #  Was This Workshop Worth My Time? #  How Much Practical Knowledge Did You Gain From The Workshop? #  Should We Have Other And More Workshops at UiO? - What Workshop or Topics Are Our Learners Missing? #  Most participants' request that we offer more - and different - workshops.\nThe main request is for courses that built on the Python and R for novices workshops.\nThere is a strong need expressed for more advanced R, especially in combination with statistical methods. This is perhaps something that other units at UiO, e.g. USIT, as well as the individual departments can address.\nSome participants ask for more workshops for Unix Shell / Bash and Git.\nThere are more requests for machine learning workshops.\nIn addition, participants request workshops for research data management, workflow management, unit tests, data preparation and cleaning, information security, GitHub, Internet of Things (IoT), programming with Fortran and Julia, and GIS.\nThere is a significant amount of participants requesting data visualisation workshops.\nAt this point, it is difficult for the Carpentry@UiO community to meet the requests that go beyond the lessons that The Carpentries offer, e.g. statistics, machine learning, other programming languages than Python and R, information security, IoT etc. Perhaps, some of these requests could be met by CodeRefinery workshops (e.g. the \u0026ldquo;advanced\u0026rdquo; versions of Carpentry lessons). Another course of action could be to share the more specific requests of some participants with USIT which has resources to offer tailored workshops and courses beyond Carpentry. Tapping into our Carpentry@UiO members' knowledge and expertise might, in addition, prove useful in developing new workshops - or episodes to existing workshops - that meet our participants' needs.\nAs a general take-away for the workshop planning for spring 2020 should not only the number of workshops on Python and R for novices be increased, but also complementary workshops on both Python and R be offered to our learners. This issue has been considered in the workshop planning.\nComments and Constructive Criticism #  Comments usually are generous and positive feedback. Some participants point out the lack of enough helpers, or comment on speed, previous knowledge, level of the workshop etc. A more frequent comment is that people get stuck and fall behind - and do not ask the helpers or instructors. This should be anticipated and accommodated for with more – and shorter – breaks. Another issue is the delay in the beginning of some workshops. This has been reduced significantly (anecdotal evidence) by explicitly stating in the course description on the uio.no course catalogue that participants need to come prepared in order to participate.\n"});index.add({'id':10,'href':'/uio-carpentry.github.io/pages/reports/survey_instructor-status_2019-09-26/','title':"Survey Instructor Status 2019 09 26",'section':"Reports",'content':"Survey – Carpentry@UiO Instructor Status Quo #  Introduction and Purpose #  Dear fellow Carpenter!\nThe Carpentry@UiO community is alive and well – a new team of coordinators from the University Library together with the Interim Board are working hard to support you in teaching workshops in the Carpentries spirit.\nIn order to gain a better and more up-to-date overview of who we are as a community, the Interim Board and the University Library have created a short survey about the status quo of our instructors.\nIf you are a certified The Carpentries instructor (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry) and you are located in the Oslo area, we kindly ask you to take 5 minutes to answer our survey.\nYour contribution will make sure that the Carpentry@UiO community thrives!\nConfidentiality #  Your responses will be collected in Nettskjema and exported as an .xlsx file to be then shared on UiO\u0026rsquo;s G-Suite platform with the members of the Interim and later Elected Board and the Carpentry@UiO coordinators at the University of Oslo Library.
