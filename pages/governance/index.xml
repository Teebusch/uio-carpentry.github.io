========================
`Carpentry@UiO `_
is the UiO local relay of the international

We are a group of volunteers from the University of Oslo and beyond.
With support from the University of Oslo Library,
we offer to PhD students, researchers and others at UiO, and beyond:
- foundational coding and data science skills workshops from
`Software Carpentry `_ and
`Data Carpentry `_
- `Study Group events `_
dedicated to open and reproducible science, knowledge sharing,
re-enforcing learning or discussing new subjects for
future workshops/lesson development
- educational development and networking opportunities with the possibility
to become Certified Carpentries Instructor
and/or Carpentries Instructor Trainer
Our activities and community are open to any member of the UiO community
including staff, faculty, and students, paid, and volunteer.</description></item></channel></rss>
